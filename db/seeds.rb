# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# one to many Demo room has many user, user belongs_to room
# room1 = Room.create(code: "room1", num_users: 2, tag: "food")
# user1 = room1.users.create(name: "user1")
# user2 = room1.users.create(name: "user2")

# room1.users # to get all users for room
# user1.room # gets room for user

# create my things
# food_thing1 = Thing.create(name: "food_thing1", tag: "food")
# food_thing2 = Thing.create(name: "food_thing2", tag: "food")
# activity_thing2 = Thing.create(name: "activity_thing2", tag: "activity")
# activity_thing2 = Thing.create(name: "activity_thing2", tag: "activity")

# room1.get_things # this get rooms things

# grab things group by tag
# Thing.all.where(tag: "food")
# Thing.all.where(tag: "activity")

# how do we like something? by adding an entry to our likes table

# like1 = food_thing1.likes.create(user_id: user1.id, room_id: room1.id)
# User.find(4).likes # this grabs user likes
# user1.things things user likes
# food_thing1.users

### how my app works
### hardcode things for now (MVP)
